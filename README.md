# Online-Shoping-Cart-Using-NodeJS
This is my first Project using NodeJS.In this ,i have been used NodeJS as Backend,MongoDB as DataBase and EJS engine for frontend.I have been implementing around all the concept for a shoping cart like differentiate between the user by using session,error page if any page is not found,User login,forget password using your Own gmail(Real time),checkout system and also PDF printing.In future,i thought to add Google and Facebook login using OAuth.
